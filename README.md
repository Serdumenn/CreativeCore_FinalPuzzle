# CreativeCore Final Puzzle

This is my Creative Core final project prototype built completely from scratch.  
The goal is to showcase Unity’s core creative systems (Shaders, Lighting, Animation, VFX, Cameras, UI, Sound, and Post-Processing) through a mini puzzle experience.

## 🎮 Concept
You start in a small puzzle room.  
- The door is locked.  
- Find and interact with a button.  
- When pressed, the environment reacts: lights turn on, particles appear, sound plays, and the door opens.  
- Step outside to complete the scene.

## 🛠️ Features
- Custom models created in **Blender**  
- Scripts written from scratch in **C#**  
- Interaction system (button & door logic)  
- Basic animations (button press, door opening)  
- Custom shaders and materials  
- VFX (sparks/particles on interaction)  
- Audio (environment + interaction feedback)  
- UI prompts (Press E to interact)  
- Post-processing (bloom, color grading, ambient occlusion)

## 🚀 Build
- Playable build will be published on **Unity Play** (WebGL).  
- Source code and assets are fully available in this repository.

## 📌 Status
Currently in development – models, scripts, and polish will be added step by step.
